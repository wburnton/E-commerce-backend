  ## Description
  Here is a e-commerce back end application used with MYSQL, express.js, and Insomnia. We create a database for items to be sold and use the server to direct where certain items should be categorized and how. A video demonstration can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-V16bJsr-8AeHbEDxKtalVIZvR6ZS0Xy/view">here</a>.

  ## Installation
  From the command line, run "npm i". Then open up mysql and source the schema.sql. Do a "npm run seed" to seed the database, and then run node index.js and go to insomnia to either get, post, put or delete items form the database. 
  ## Usage
  Use database to add new items, see what's already in stock, and adjust the categorizing but replacing or deleting.
